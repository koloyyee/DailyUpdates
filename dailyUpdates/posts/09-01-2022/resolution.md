# New Year's Resolution

This year is 2022, the 3rd year into the pandemic, the event gave me second chance into my career, and into a new area, an area that previously F&B never experienced, and may new technology finally are able to be utilized in this old and outdated industry. I like programming and I believe there are many new area that F&B needed a new update, not just using inductions or going gas-free, it is more about having the technology to solve the issues with lack of labours and lowering the cost while maintaining the quality.

The coming blog post I will express my thoughts on what are the keys to F&B, especially when it comes to kitchen.
