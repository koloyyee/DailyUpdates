# It is all about control

I have been in the F&B industry for over a decade now since 2020, I have been for working in a food delivery company the title is R&D Chef, I do recipe development and concepts being used by the operators, but I learn even more.

## Disciplines and rules

In the world of F&B, control is everything. All chefs are control freaks, and we need to control the quality, the food cost, labor cost, etc., our margin is tight, and our customers are not forgiving, they will give you one chance, and that's it, that's why control is the most important. However, human-like any creatures, we are all hard to control, my experience in fine dining taught me why discipline is important, but in restaurants with cooks and chefs that care even less, discipline is not an easy thing to find. Therefore, rules are needed, they are painful at first,but it is a protection for both parties, that's why we need a system.

## System

SOP, standard operation procedures, usually used in aviation industry, medical field, factory production, these are the checklist for safeties. Many times in the kitchens, cooks (I still do) trust that another cook by their experience, we rely on another's experience and instincts than a robust system to check the standards.

A good system which created by users, for the users, it will judge a person by his/hers action, rather than experience and sentiments.

More and more, I believe in systems, systems that were developed by different parties to hold each and everyone accountable a good system is not about efficiency but effectiveness. My current work exposed me to learn, create and understand the importance of SOPs, and in the age of kitchen understaffed, SOPs, recipes are the savior for kitchen operations heavy rely on part-time or staff with less-experienced, because most of the diners care about *consistency, value, & experience*, our goal is to deliver them, and through a robust and good system, everyone shall benefit, after all hospitality industry is about taking care of another, not just customers but employees, and stakeholders, too.
