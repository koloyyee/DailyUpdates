# It is all about control

I have been in the F&B industry for over a decade now, since 2020, I had been for working in a food delivery company the title is R&D Chef, I do develope food and concepts being used by the operators, but I learn even more.

## Disciplines and rules

In the world of F&B, control is everything. All chefs are control freaks, we need to control the quality, the food cost, labour cost, etc. our margin is tight, and our customers are not forgiving, they will give you one chance and that's it, that's why control is the most important. However, human like any creatures, we are all the hard to control, my experience in fine dining taught me why discipline are important, but in the restaurants with cooks and chefs that care less, discipline is not an easy thing to find, therefore rules are need, they are painful at first but it is a protection for both parties, that's why we need system.

## System

SOP, standard operation procedures, usually used in aviation industry, medical field, factory production, these are the checklist for safeties, for meeting the standard. Many times in the kitchen we all have (I still do) trust that person's experience, problem usually occurs when people far too rely on their instincts than a robust system. System is created by people, for the people, a good system will avoid the judgement by ones experience and sentiment over a person but the system will judge a person by his/hers action.

More and more I believe in systems, systems that developed by different parties to hold each and everyone accountable, a good system is not about efficiency but effectiveness. My current work expose me to learn, create and understand the importance of SOPs, and in the age of kitchen understaffed, SOPs, recipes are the saviour for kitchen operations heavy rely on part-time or staff with less-experience, because most of the diners cares about *consistency, value, & experience*, our goal is to deliver them, and through a robust and good system, everyone shall benefit, after all hospitality industry is about taking care of another, not just customers but employees, and stakeholders, too.
