# Moving forward

Moving forward for this site, this site will be my blog and testing different programming related topics, projects. My blog will always related to food, programming, data, I can see that the current version of the site can only fetch news from 3 news agency outlets, in the future I would like to have different news agencies' daily news headline be fetched back and process with NLP models for sentiments analysis.

### food and tech

Also I am quite interested in machine learning, I hope I could scrape recipes and do a machines learning run on recipes to find and test them so I can share with the internet. As I have believe food & beverage industry at restaurant level that truly need a tech update, from software, websites, to robotics and recipes, I have many ideas on my mind and I would love to test them out and share with the world.

### editor or md file

This blog right now is full of flaws, there are many spot I'll have to update it. Although I enjoy creating Markdown then push to the github, however, moving forward I will have to decided whether I should include a markdown editor in the website with a personal login for better use.

At the moment I will change this site bit by bit, and set up the next few projects ahead of me, until next time!
