### Timing

Recently the Nasdaq has been going down for days and the downward trend was caused by tech stocks sell-off, the fed rates raise concerns, I, too needless to say had to trim my losing positions and it hurts, but if we think about it, the timing is always the key to make or break, profit or loss.

We can't time the market unless you are into the technical analysis, but timing the market is hard and also most impossible because there are so much money rolling, so much information floating, I can never tell when it is right time to buy or sell as an amateur investor, therefore I have believe in fundamental analysis, and it is not easy job to find and understand the company that interest me.

Although we can't time the market what happen when I do find the company interested me? Here is why I think Warren Buffett is the *best* investor ever, because most of the time when he invests, usually the right time and right price, maybe except Kraft Heinz(?), so learning when to enter and exit seems to be most challenging part of my investment so far. I have some good times and bad times, for the bad ones I usually feel it was my bad "timing" and I didn't sold them ASAP.

### Selling is an art

Selling is an art for me, but there are lots of leads and hints for an investor especially the short term investor to sell it as soon as it is "right", but I do think that if I had set the target profit % or $, I would take profit sooner and make my account safe, however, that will be based on luck too, after all when do we sell it is an art than an exact science, because "what-if" the stock goes up even more?

### Timing to enter

I started to believe there is no real timing to enter but as an investor I need to have the discipline to enter the market based on the value, just like start or buying a business, it is the value and return that the current market and the business' value determine it is worth capital and our time to invest.
